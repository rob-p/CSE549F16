This is the course website for CSE549 (Fall 2016) at Stony Brook University.
The focus of this course will be on algorithmic and computational ideas in 
Computational Biology and Bioinformatics --- it is intended for students with
a computational background and a reasonable level of mathematical maturity.
No Biological expertise is assumed, but Biology drives and motivates all of
the problems we will study, so you will be expected to learn the Biology that 
is relevant to the topics we cover.
